I first uploaded pandas and sklearn. I also imported Logistic Regression, accuracy_score and train_test_split.
I then uploaded the data from the csv file into a dataset.
I also had to get dummies for the dataset because Logistic Regression doesn't work as well with strings.
Following that, I divided the data set into a training set and test set with a 70:30 split.

For the algorithm, I used Logistic Regression.
I then plotted the training data and used the logistic regression library's fit function to create a line of best fit.
The main reason I chose logistic regression was due to the fact that the data was primarily non-linear and logistic regression encapsulates many datasets of this form.
Finally, I used the predict function of the LR library to predict the y_test based off of the X_test.

In conclusion, I calculated the accuracy based on the prior prediction.
